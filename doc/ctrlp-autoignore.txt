INTRO                                           *ctrlp-autoignore-intro*

This extension for the CtrlP plugin adds support for a `.ctrlpignore` file
located at the root of your project. This file will be read when CtrlP
initializes, and any patterns found in it will be excluded from search
results. It's basically like `.gitignore` or `.hgignore` but for CtrlP.

|CtrlPAutoIgnore| requires a recent version of CtrlP that supports custom
filtering functions. The original CtrlP project has been inactive since its
autor mysteriously disappeared, and won't support that feature.  You'll have
to switch to the new official (and active!) repository here:
https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim.

NOTE: Currently, |CtrlPAutoIgnore| won't work if you're using a custom file
listing command (see |g:ctrlp_user_command|).

===============================================================================
INSTALLATION                                    *ctrlp-autoignore-installation*

To install this plugin, add its files to somewhere Vim will find them. It's
recommended you use something like Pathogen or Vundle.

Then, activate it like any other CtrlP extension. For instance, in your:

  let g:ctrlp_extensions = ['autoignore']

For more information, see |ctrlp-extensions|.

Note: |CtrlPAutoIgnore| will add `.ctrlpignore` to |g:ctrlp_root_markers| so
it's used as a root marker.

===============================================================================
OPTIONS                                         *ctrlp-autoignore-options*

|CtrlPAutoIgnore| doesn't have any options.

===============================================================================
IGNORE FILE SYNTAX                              *ctrlp-autoignore-syntax*

|CtrlPAutoIgnore| will load any `.ctrlpignore` file located at the root of the
current CtrlP project (as defined by |g:ctrlp_root_markers|, among other
things).

Empty lines, and lines starting with `#` (comments) are ignored.

Other lines are treated like regular expression patterns. See *string-match*
for how patterns are used. Anything that matches any of the patterns will be
ignored from CtrlP's search results.

Example:

  \.tmp$
  ^generated/
  local\.cfg

NOTE: Patterns should use forward slashes, even on Windows.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS                      *ctrlp-autoignore-faq*

Q: Why can't |CtrlPAutoIgnore| support `.gitignore` or `.hgignore` natively?

A: Those files look at first like they may contain all the patterns you'd want
to exclude from CtrlP already. However, more often than not, there are some
differences. Those files list patterns that should not be included in
source-control. This includes things you want to ignore, but also things you
may not want to: local settings, external packages and dependencies, etc. The
author felt the trouble of supporting various syntaxes was too much compared
to just copy/pasting a few lines. Freel free to contribute a patch if you
disagree :)

Q: I enabled |CtrlPAutoIgnore|, or edited `.ctrlpignore`, but none of the new
patterns are working. What did I do wrong?

A: Probably nothing! CtrlP can cache search results for faster response times.
You can hit <F5> to force it to refresh. This will use the newer ignore
patterns.
